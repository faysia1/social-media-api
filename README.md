# Social Media API

This API is designed as a social networking tool to get all, create, and update users. It is also to post, delete, and view thoughts.

# Installation
I used MogoDB, Insomnia, and Express.js for this API.

# Usage
The purpose of this site is to manage information on a social networking API.
